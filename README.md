## Overview

**Djinn** (jinn) are supernatural beings in Islamic theology and pre-Islamic Arabian mythology, created by God from **smokeless fire** (humans were created from clay, angels from light). They are invisible to humans under normal circumstances but can manifest in various forms.

Djinn possess **free will**, meaning they can choose to be good, evil, or neutral, and are morally accountable for their actions just as humans are. In Islamic belief, djinn have their own societies parallel to humans, with families, religions, and nations. They can be Muslim or non-Muslim.

Types of djinn include **Marid** (powerful), **Ifrit** (malevolent), **Ghul** (demonic), and **Jann** (least powerful). Djinn possess powers including shape-shifting, invisibility, possession, superhuman abilities, and flight.

In Islamic tradition, the prophet **Suleiman (Solomon)** was granted control over djinn and used them to build temples and perform great works. The Quran mentions djinn extensively, and **Iblis (Satan)** is identified as a djinn who refused to bow to Adam.

⚠️ **Critical Note**: While Western popular culture depicts "genies" as wish-granting spirits in lamps (from Arabian Nights), this is a **significant misrepresentation**. The "three wishes" trope is NOT part of traditional Islamic or Arabian djinn theology.

🕌 **Religious Sensitivity**: Djinn are part of **living Islamic religious belief** for millions of Muslims worldwide. This is theological reality, not merely folklore.

## The "Genie" Misrepresentation

### Western vs. Islamic Understanding

⚠️ **Critical Distinction**:

| Aspect | Islamic/Arabian Tradition | Western "Genie" Stereotype |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Nature** | Beings with free will, societies, religions | Wish-granting servants |
| **Wishes** | NOT part of theology | "Three wishes" trope |
| **Containment** | Not typically imprisoned in lamps/bottles | Lamp/bottle imprisonment common |
| **Disposition** | Morally complex, can be good/evil | Usually comedic or servile |
| **Status** | Theological beings subject to God | Magical servants of humans |

### Origins of Misrepresentation

1. **Arabian Nights**: Medieval folk tales (not religious texts) featured some djinn stories with embellishments
2. **Victorian Orientalism**: 19th-century European fascination with exoticized "Orient"
3. **Literary adaptations**: Western authors took creative liberties
4. **Hollywood**: Disney's *Aladdin* (1992) and similar works created lasting stereotypes

**The "three wishes" concept is largely a Western invention**, not authentic to Islamic theology or most Arabian folklore.
