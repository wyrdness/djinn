      "full": "Djinn (jinn) are supernatural beings in Islamic theology and pre-Islamic Arabian mythology, created by God from smokeless fire (humans were created from clay, angels from light). They are invisible to humans under normal circumstances but can manifest in various forms. Djinn possess free will, meaning they can choose to be good, evil, or neutral, and are morally accountable for their actions just as humans are. In Islamic belief, djinn have their own societies parallel to humans, with families, religions, and nations. They can be Muslim or non-Muslim. Types of djinn include Marid (powerful), Ifrit (malevolent), Ghul (demonic), and Jann (least powerful). Djinn possess powers including shape-shifting, invisibility, possession, superhuman abilities, and flight. In Islamic tradition, the prophet Suleiman (Solomon) was granted control over djinn and used them to build temples and perform great works. The Quran mentions djinn extensively, and Iblis (Satan) is identified as a djinn who refused to bow to Adam. While Western popular culture often depicts genies as wish-granting spirits in lamps (from Arabian Nights tales), this is a significant misrepresentation; the 'three wishes' trope is not part of traditional Islamic or Arabian djinn theology."
